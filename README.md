## Done
- [X] Add MonoGame and Inno Setup licenses
- [X] Come up with an actual name for the game
- [X] AOE turret effects
- [X] Audio system 
- [X] Encrypt user data
    - Just so that you cant just as easily give yourself buffs and stuff
    - Maybe only do this in release mode, since it will be a hassle while debugging
- [X] Improve the game integrity checker
    - Right now, it only rly checks IDs of turrets and enemy types
- [X] CLI tool for checking mods
- [X] Viewport the range circle
    - So it stays within the game field
- [X] Make attribute interfaces for modules
- [X] Multipathed maps
- [X] Passive turret
    - E.g. a turret that does not shoot but increases range of others. 
- [X] Progressive turret and enemy unlocks
- [X] Achivement list
- [X] Fix turrets not being disabled with insufficient funds
- [X] Multiple "pages" of turret upgrades
- [X] Multiple "pages" of turrets
- [X] Multiple "pages" of maps
- [X] Multiple "pages" of gamestyles
- [X] Achievements 
- [X] Carry over system
    - Something like, each game if you kill `n` amount of enemies you can permanently do 1% more damage across all following games (or something like it)
    - [X] Upgrade menu for this
- [X] Score board
- [X] User system (to save scores and permanent upgrades) 
- [X] Fix missile turret not guiding

- [X] Black list turret ids (and enemy IDs) in GameStyles 
    - Could be useful if you where to make a "bullets only" GameStyle or something like that 
- [X] Enemy modules like the turret system
    - Could be interesting to make boss enemies handled separately with unique modules
- [X] Animated projectiles
- [X] Animated enemies
- [X] Enemy selection typs
    - I.e. shoot at the closest, the weakest, the farthest, etc. 
- [X] Flying and ground enemies (as well as turrets that only work against those types of enemies)
- [X] Enemy spawn offset
    - To make the enemy spawning look a bit more "random"
- [X] Selling turrets
- [X] Texture pack levels (at least the setup for it)
- [x] A static base for turrets?
    - So that its not only just a whole part moving
- [X] Propper upgrade panel descriptions
- [X] Show turret info when buying a new turret (in the turret stats window)
- [X] Show the name and texture of enemies in the "enemy queue" list
- [X] Actual bullet turret type (maybe just a fast projectile will work?)
- [X] Trailing projectile turrets

- [X] Animated turrets
    - [X] Different animations for different actions (e.g. shooting vs idle)

    - I.e. some turrets are more effective against certain enemy types

- [X] Cache tile sets (for animated tiles)
- [X] Area of effect turret
- [X] Slowdown turret
