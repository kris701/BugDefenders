## TODO List
- [ ] Score board
- [ ] Animated enemies
- [ ] Animated projectiles
- [ ] Enemy selection typs
    - I.e. shoot at the closest, the weakest, the farthest, etc. 
- [ ] Carry over system
    - Something like, each game if you kill `n` amount of enemies you can permanently do 1% more damage across all following games (or something like it)
    - [ ] Upgrade menu for this
    - [ ] GameStyle that disallows permanent upgrades
- [X] Flying and ground enemies (as well as turrets that only work against those types of enemies)
- [X] Enemy spawn offset
    - To make the enemy spawning look a bit more "random"
- [X] Selling turrets
- [X] Texture pack levels (at least the setup for it)
- [x] A static base for turrets?
    - So that its not only just a whole part moving
- [X] Propper upgrade panel descriptions
- [X] Show turret info when buying a new turret (in the turret stats window)
- [X] Show the name and texture of enemies in the "enemy queue" list
- [X] Actual bullet turret type (maybe just a fast projectile will work?)
- [X] Trailing projectile turrets
- [X] Turret Upgrade values
- [X] Animated turrets
    - [X] Different animations for different actions (e.g. shooting vs idle)
- [X] Enemy health bar
- [X] Enemy boss waves
- [X] Enemy types
    - I.e. some turrets are more effective against certain enemy types
- [X] Use a different font (Consolas maybe?)
- [X] FPS counter
- [X] Cache tile sets (for animated tiles)
- [X] Area of effect turret
- [X] Slowdown turret
- [X] Mod support
- [X] Investment "turrets" 
    - Turrets that don't shoot, but generate money 
- [X] Combined enemy waves
